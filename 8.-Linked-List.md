# Linked List Intro

A linked list is a linear data structure similar to an array.

[Arrays vs Linked Lists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyG9S9nAlUM)

Unlike arrays, elements are not stored in a particular memory location or index. Rather each element is a separate object that contains a pointer or a link to the next object in that list.

Each element (commonly called nodes) contains two items: the data stored and a link to the next node. The data can be any valid data type.

The entry point to a linked list is called the head. The head is a reference to the first node in the linked list. The last node on the list points to null. If a list is empty, the head is a null reference.

There are two types of linked list: singly linked list and doubly linked list.

Each node in a singly-linked list contains not only the value but also a reference field to link to the next node. 

By this way, the singly-linked list organizes all the nodes in a sequence.

# An advantage of Linked Lists
Nodes can easily be removed or added from a linked list without reorganizing the entire data structure. This is one advantage it has over arrays.

# Disadvantages of Linked Lists
* Search operations are slow in linked lists. Unlike arrays, random access of data elements is not allowed. Nodes are accessed sequentially starting from the first node.
* It uses more memory than arrays because of the storage of the pointers.

# Operations
Unlike the array, we are not able to access a random element in a singly-linked list in constant time. 
If we want to get the ith element, we have to traverse from the head node one by one. 
It takes us O(N) time on average to visit an element by index, where N is the length of the linked list.

## Add Operation
Unlike an array, we donâ€™t need to move all elements past the inserted element. Therefore, you can insert a new node into a linked list in O(1) time complexity, which is very efficient.

``` javascript
class LinkedList {
    constructor(value) {
        this.head = {
            value: value,
            next: null
        };
        this.tail = this.head;
        this.length = 1;
    }
    append(value) {
      const newNode = {
        value: value,
        next: null
      }
      console.log(newNode)
      this.tail.next = newNode;
      this.tail = newNode;
      this.length++;
      return this;
    }
    prepend(value) {
      const newNode = {
        value: value,
        next: null
      }
      newNode.next = this.head;
      this.head = newNode;
      this.length++;
      return this;
    }
    printList() {
      const array = [];
      let currentNode = this.head;
      while(currentNode !== null){
          array.push(currentNode.value)
          currentNode = currentNode.next
      }
      return array;
    }
    insert(index, value){
      //Check for proper parameters;
      if(index >= this.length) {
        console.log('yes')
        return this.append(value);
      }
      
      const newNode = {
        value: value,
        next: null
      }
      const leader = this.traverseToIndex(index-1);
      const holdingPointer = leader.next;
      leader.next = newNode;
      newNode.next = holdingPointer;
      this.length++;
      return this.printList();
    }
    traverseToIndex(index) {
      //Check parameters
      let counter = 0;
      let currentNode = this.head;
      while(counter !== index){
        currentNode = currentNode.next;
        counter++;
      }
      return currentNode;
    }
    remove(index) {
      // Check Parameters      
      const leader = this.traverseToIndex(index-1);
      const unwantedNode = leader.next;
      leader.next = unwantedNode.next;
      this.length--;
      return this.printList();
    }
    reverse() {
      if (!this.head.next) {
        return this.head;
      }
      let first = this.head;
      this.tail = this.head;
      let second = first.next;
  
      while(second) {
        const temp = second.next;
        second.next = first;
        first = second;
        second = temp;
      }
  
      this.head.next = null;
      this.head = first;
      return this.printList();
    }
}

let myLinkedList = new LinkedList(10);
myLinkedList.append(5)
myLinkedList.append(16)
myLinkedList.prepend(1)
myLinkedList.printList()
myLinkedList.insert(2, 99)
myLinkedList.insert(20, 88)
myLinkedList.printList()
myLinkedList.remove(2)
myLinkedList.reverse()
